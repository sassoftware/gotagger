The minimum version of go is now 1.17.
Go 1.18 was released on 2022-03-15,
which means go 1.16 is now EOL.

The go version in the go.mod is updated to 1.17,
so that gotagger can take advantage of the depdnency pruning changes
introduced in that version of go.
Generally,
this is not desirable,
but this time the benefits are worth the potential disruption.
